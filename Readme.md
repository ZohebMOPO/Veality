## Inspiration
All my childhood I have played varieties of games. Games that uplift your emotions and take all the heaviness of your mind
## What it does
The game interface contains various bubbles and animals. The main avatar is the fish who drinks all the bubbles in which `positive words` are written. This leads to an increase in the score.
## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, and JS. JS brought all the animation to the website.
## Challenges we ran into
We had never tried game dev. Game dev requires maths. In web dev, we have never done such math things. This was the first time to think about what coordinates the fish will be and the objects and how they will move accordingly. How the sound will pop on when the fish eats a bubble
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we made a game on the web. There are very few games available on the internet which reduce stress and uplifts emotions.  
## What we learned
We have never tried game dev, not even the `Rhino chrome` ðŸ˜‚. Understanding the coordinates and making it was hectic but it was fruitful for sure.
## What's next for OceanOfPositivity
We are looking forward to making it multi-platform like in android, iOS, and Mac/Windows. Also, we are really looking forward to taking the graphics next level and making it a `3d` game.
